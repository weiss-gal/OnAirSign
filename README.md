# OnAirSign
"On-Air" led sign - controller application

<mark>This project is currently under construction. </mark>

update [12-Jan-2021]: Nearly there ! well - it works quite well already, some finishes are required so I will be able to sleep well, but if you are curious enough you are more than welcome to give it a go. 

Add to your watch list to know when its finally usable (ETA - a matter of days)

The target is to create an arduino based "on air" sign, connected to a PC via USB cable, 
the sign is using an 8x32 led matrix to present the status of your speakers, microphone and camera, letting peoeple around you know when you should not be interrupted.

The arduino part of this project (should work for any arduino device) can be found here: https://github.com/weiss-gal/OnAirSign-Arduino
