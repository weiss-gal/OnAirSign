# OnAirSign
"On-Air" led sign - controller application

<mark>This project is currnetly under construction. </mark>

update [14-Oct-2020]: We are nearly there ! I have the complete end-to-end concept working, animations updated correctly on the arduino. 
Hang on there, home workers, your "On Air" sign is nearly there.

Add to your watch list to know when its finally usable (ETA - a matter of days)

The target is to create an arduino based "on air" sign, connected to a PC via USB cable, 
the sign is using an 8x32 led matrix to present the status of your speakers, microphone and camera, letting peoeple around you know when you should not be interrupted.
