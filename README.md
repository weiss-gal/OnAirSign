update [30-Jan-2021]: Finally - the beta version is completed and ready for everyone to use.

The target is to create an arduino based "on air" sign, connected to a PC via USB cable, 
the sign is using an 8x32 led matrix to present the status of your speakers and microphone (camera will be added at some point), letting peoeple around you know when you should not be interrupted.
